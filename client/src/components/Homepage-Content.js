                <p className="homepage-pg">Sacramento is the nation's Farm to Fork Capital and it inspired us to want to bring the weekend farmer's market to eveyone's home. Whether it be a community based garden stall, a living wall of herbs, or an indoor
                garden, growers are sometimes faced with a produce in abundance. Too many tomatos? No worries! That's why we created Bountiful, a peer-to-peer produce sharing app.
                Where non-commercial gardeners can connect with their local community members to buy and sell produce and other locally grown goods.</p>
